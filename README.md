# 42-cpp04
Fifth day of the c++ basics learning of the 42 school.

## How to use it

There is a Makefile for compiling (`make`) cleaning the project (`make clean`, `make fclean`) and rebuild it (`make re`).

## Tasks

### Ex00 to 02

All of these exercises are meant to help us practice and understand inheritance and polymorphism (abstract and interfaces classes). It's full of cats and dog, a brain (ex01) with thaughts. 

### Ex03

Same as before but this is a simulation of RPG equiment with spells to cast. It gains in complexity with abstract and interfaces mixing each others.
